    <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is Campus Design & Copy?</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 4rem 4rem;">Campus Design & Copy is a student-run
        cooperative business on the campus of the University of Massachusetts
        Amherst. CD&C provides printing, design, photography, and photocopying services to UMass Amherst and the
        surrounding community. CD&C also provides printed academic materials for many courses offered at the University.
        We take pride in providing quality print, design, and photography services for students, by students.

        CD&C is one of seven student businesses at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Other businesses on campus
        include Earthfoods, a vegetarian café on the first floor of Bartlett Hall; People’s Market, an organic, fair
        trade coffee shop located on the first floor of Bartlett Hall; Greeno Sub Shop, a sandwich shop in the basement
        of the Greenough dorm in Central; Sylvan Snackbar, a late night snack shop in Sylvan, Sweets & More, an ice
        cream and sweets shop located in the Field dorm in Orchard Hill; and Bike Coop, a bicycle sale and service shop
        on the first floor of Bartlett Hall.

        Campus Design & Copy is managed by a team of full-time undergraduate students at UMass. Every member of our
        store is a “Co-Manager,” with all staff holding equal responsibility in our business’ success and growth. Our
        Co-Managers serve in roles ranging from business and financial management to graphic design to photography.
        Further, all Co-Managers are experienced providing our clients with outstanding and affordable print, design,
        and photography services.

        CD&C hires new co-managers every semester, and maintains a staff ranging from 10 to 14 people. Please visit our
        store, our website, or any of our social media pages listed on Campus Pulse for information related to our
        hiring, which typically takes place three to four weeks after the beginning of each semester.

        Our office is temporarily located on the third floor of Bartlett Hall while the Student Union undergoes
        renovations.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is a Cooperative?</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 4rem 4rem;">Campus Design & Copy is considered a
        co-operative. Although we receive some support from the university, as a
        business we are completely student run. With the way we operate there is no boss. Instead, all of the
        responsibilities associated with running the business are shared among our members or “Co-Managers” as we call
        ourselves. All administrative decisions and policies are decided unanimously and conflicts in our business are
        resolved through communication and constructive debate. Although all of our Co-Managers are equal, our specific
        responsibilities differ. Aspects of our business such as marketing, information technology and human resources
        are managed by committees. Members work together during the semester to focus on the goals of each committee and
        they are periodically reshuffled. In addition, we are a non-profit. The money we make is reinvested back into
        our business to afford more resources that we can use to better serve the community.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 4rem 4rem;">Being a Co-Manager at Campus Design & Copy
        is more than just a job. We exist as a community resource and our
        values as a company reflect that. This unique business structure allows us to peruse environmentally friendly
        and social justice oriented goals. Being part of CD&C has been an extremely formative experience for many of our
        Co-Managers and alumni. As much as we try to support the students of UMass, we support each other. We value the
        ability to make a difference and learn along the way.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Mission Statement</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">Campus Design & Copy is an undergraduate,
        student-initiated and managed business at the University of Massachusetts. Our purpose are as follows:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">To provide undergraduate

    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">To serve the University
        community with copying, designing, binding, computer, and finishing services.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">To promote the
        co-operative and collective movement.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">Campus Design and Copy is a not-for-profit
        organization and operates under the model, "Students working for
        students"; aiming to foster ideals of equality and diversity in the workplace.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">More Cooperative History</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">The first cooperative was formed in
        Rochdale, England in 1844 by one woman and 27 men, who would become known as the "Rochdale Pioneers." This group
        of people put together a set of principles that all co-ops use. The Rochdale Principles are as follows:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">1. Open Membership:
        Membership to the co-op is voluntary and there is no discrimination on the basis of race, sex, gender,
        sexuality, or religious or political affiliation.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">2. Democratic Control:
        One member, one vote. This principle guards against control by the few for the benefit of the few.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">3. Limited Return on
        Equity Capital: Money made is reinvested in the business.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">4. Net-Surplus Belongs
        to User-Owners: The net savings of a co-op may be distributed equitably among the membership, or used in some
        other agreed upon manner, either for the benefit of the group or for the local community as a whole.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">5. Continuous Education:
        Co-ops act to educate their members and the local community about the principles, methods, problems and goals of
        the organization.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">6. Cooperation among
        Cooperatives: To strengthen themselves and to serve members and the community better, co-ops need to work
        together at the local, regional, national and international levels.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify; margin-block:inherit; margin: 1rem 4rem;">7. Political
        Non-Partisanship: Adhering to the goals of a particular political party or agenda would limit membership, thus
        violating the open membership principle. This does not mean that co-ops must be politically inactive, but it
        does mean that co-ops have usually chosen to limit their political activity to those issues directly affecting
        the co-op movement and the industries they are a part of.</p>

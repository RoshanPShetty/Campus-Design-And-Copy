# Campus-Design-And-Copy

This is a website template that I created for Campus Design And Copy, a run business at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It showcases 4 pages that are the Home, Course Packets, Services, Co Managers, and Student Businesses. It is responsive so it can viewed on any device that you want.
